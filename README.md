# AJAX - Asychronous Javascript and XML

- AJAX allows web pages to be updated asynchronously by exchanging data with a web server behind the scenes. This means that it is possible to update parts of a web page, without reloading the whole page.

## HTTP Requests - Communcation between Client and Server

- XMLHttpRequest (XHR) objects are used to interact with servers. You can retrieve data from a URL without having to do a full page refresh. This enables a Web page to update just part of a page without disrupting what the user is doing.

Despite its name, XMLHttpRequest can be used to retrieve any type of data, not just XML.

## API - Application Programming Interface
